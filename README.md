# Deep Learning Project
## Project Overview
SDAIA Bootcamp project 5 - Deep Learning. 

The main goal of this project is to classify the heart condition from the heart sound. Using neural network tools such as Keras, we built multiple neural network models with the appropriate use of layers to handle the heart sound recordings. LSTM neural network model has the best performance on classifying heart conditions through audio as it achieved recall of 0.96.

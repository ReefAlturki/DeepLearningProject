##  Recognizing Abnormal Heart Rate - Problem



Cardiovascular diseases have been a major cause of death amongst the world population. Approximately 17.1 million cases of deaths due to CVD were reported in 2004. This accounts for 29% of the global deaths. Thus, there has been an increased focus on the development of deep learning
approaches for heart sound classification.


The automated classification of heart sounds plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, the problem is that there are still limitations in the classification task due to insufficient data and inefficient training. Denoting that there is a need to build an effective model to classify the heart condition.

  

## Classifying Heart Condition
  

The main goal of this project is to classify the heart condition from a heart rate audio. Using neural network tools such as Keras, we plan to build a neural network model with the appropriate use of layers to handle the heart rate audios, and to effectively classify normal/abnormal heart conditions. 


  

### Data Source
  
In this project we aquired heart sound audio data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/swapnilpanda/heart-sound-database). The dataset is collected from physioNet website and it consists of 3540 original PCG audio recordings resampled at 2000Hz. The raw data provided is in [.WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV). format, which is an encoding of an audio. 
## MVP
- Summerizing and exploring the data.
- Defining classification metrics.
- Building the Model Baseline.
